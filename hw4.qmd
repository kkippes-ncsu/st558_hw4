## Task 1: Conceptual Questions

###

## Task 2: Writing R Functions

```{r}
1 + 1
```

## Task 3: Querying an API and a Tidy-Style Function

### Question 1

The purpose of $lapply()$ is to apply functions to each element of a list and returns a list. The equivalent $purrr$ function is $map()$.

### Question 2

```{r}
lapply(my_list, cor, method = "kendall")
```

### Question 3

1. It gives cleaner and more readable code.
2. It provides more functionality.

### Question 4 

A side-effect function doesn't try to change or transform the data, it just tries to produce something.

### Question 5

This is because when you call a function, it creates a temporary function environment (lexical scoping).
